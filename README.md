# Progressive-GAN-pytorch
A pytorch implementation of Progressive-GAN that is actually works, readable and simple to customize

## Description
I simplify the code of training a Progressive-GAN, making it easier to read and customize, for the purpose of research.  
This implementation is portable with minimal library dependency (only torch and torchvision) and just 2 code modules. In the code, you can easily modeify the training-schema, the loss function, and the network structure, etc.  
The key contributions in the paper: 1. progressively growing og GAN, 2. minibatch std on Discriminator, 3. pixel-norm on Generator, 4. equalized learning rate; are all implemented.  
Enjoy the benefit of the progressive-growing infrastructure and port it to your own research and product!

## How to run
To start a training, just run:
```
python train.py --path /path/to/image-folder
```
An example with more configuration can be:
```
python train.py --path /path/to/imagefolder --trial_name experiment-1 --z_dim 100 --channel 512 --batch_size 4 --init_step 2 --total_iter 300000 --pixel_norm --tanh
```
For a comprehensive explanation of all the parameters, run:
```
python train.py --help
```
  
Each new running of the code will create a new folder with the specified trail_name, all the generated images, model checkpoints and loss value loging file will be stored in this new folder. A copy of the codes that you run will also be intimately stored (because you might have modefied them).

## Dataset
This code is ready for your own image datasets with the **torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder** module.  
Place all your images in a way like:
```
<image_root_folder>
        |--<subfolder 1>
                |--image 1
                |--image 2 ...
        |--<subfolder 2>
        ...
```

## Training results
This code performs consistently well on various datasets I tested, I just don't bother upload them here.
